# JohnBenedictGameLemonJaunt
This is the repository of John Benedict Ocampo Divinagracia for the game he is building for his Games Analysis and Design module (5N1651). This game is based on Unity's John Lemon tutorial.

This game was not made from scratch but rather, a modified version of Unity's (game engine) tutorial as a way of presenting one's knowledge of Unity game engine.
As per the teacher's instruction the following documents were added in the repository:
    1) the game source file (my project)
    2) .exe file (Dublin Zombie Heist)

the following features were changed in the game:
    1) Set the intensity of bloom from 2.5 to 30. it made all bright objects brighter. In the darker settings, it makes a very eerie effect. Luminescence exhibit an effect of eeriness, majesty, and ethereality

    2)I Made the duration of the display to be 3 seconds because I want my jump scare to be longer so that it adds an added scary feel. The main reason I want to remove the fade is that I want the jumpscare to be fast so that its scarier

    3) Made all the capsule collider of each ghosts' point of view: center z=-0.3 instead of 0.95. and radius to 0.4 instead of 2 and direction as y-axis instead of the z-axis. What this does is that instead of ghosts, zombies that have no sense of sight will be added. You lose by touching them not by being in their sight.

    4) Changed the game over Canvas to a scarier image

Instructions document for the assesment is also in the repository
